# Samal Local IDP

This is a local IDP used to authenticate development.

## Usage

To use this project, open a terminal into this directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start it with:

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure bolt and bolt-react are started on your machine and go to
`localhost:7000` in your browser. The default sign-in credentials are for the
username "dev-user" - you may change them on the webpage or change
`config.js` in this folder and re-start this server to sign in as a different
user.

Scroll to the bottom and click "Sign In", and you should be authenticated.
